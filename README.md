# Spring Batch Grid #

Aggregator for various other projects that provide grid features in Spring Batch (which might have independent release cycles).

To build, clone from git and then

    $ cd spring-batch-grid
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ mvn install

Any errors should be due to problems in the submodules, so they need to be addressed there.
